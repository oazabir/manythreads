# STATUS

Current phase: **2 · Identity, workspace and teams** (next)

| Phase | State | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Foundations | done — gate green locally and in CI; retro `docs/retro/phase-1.md` | phase-1 / v0.1.0 |
| 2–13 | not started | |

## Phase 1 summary
All tasks P1-01…P1-13 merged with reviewer PASS (P1-04b security hardening added: system actor = real
`majlis_system` role). Benchmarks: `docs/retro/bench-phase-1.md`. Deploy: `docs/deploy.md`.
Screens: `docs/retro/screens/phase-1/`.

## Follow-ups carried into later phases
- Trigram search plan under RLS needs scoping/plan check before phase 3 search.
- Response schemas enforced for 200 only; extend per route as needed.
- CNPG `majlis_owner` is superuser (needed for extensions/roles); CNPG chart version unpinned.
- `it.todo`: Zod enum vs SQL CHECK comparison test — do in phase 2 when first enum tables land.
- pnpm cyclic workspace dep warning (kernel ↔ test-utils ↔ server devDeps).
- RN on-device benchmark deferred to phase 11 gate (Chromium proxy passed).
- Dev-header actor (`packages/server/src/dev-actor.ts`) must be replaced by real auth in phase 2
  (keep a test-only auth bypass for screenshots, gated by env).

## Environment / blockers
- SSH to the server is blocked from the sandbox; deploys run from GitHub Actions (secret ROOT_PASSWORD).
  Deploy rule (owner): pushing a version tag `v*` deploys latest `main`. Each phase exit: PR → main,
  tag `phase-N` + `v0.N.0`. Ops workflows: ops-rollout/restart/rollback/logs/status (dispatch from main).
- Free-form ops workflows (any command / SQL) were declined by the permission classifier — owner decision pending.
